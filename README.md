The Python code for my Statistics and Probability course. You have to select a dataset and a column from the dataset. The code only works in a column from a dataset. It contains a few statistical calculations:
- Mean of the column
- Median of the column
- Variance, standart deviation and standart error
- Deciding the shape of distribution
- Finding outliers
- Graphing the column data using histogram
- Drawing boxplot
- Taking specific number of sample and constructing %95 confidence interval for the mean and 
variance
- How large a sample for our data should be collected to estimate the population mean with a 
margin at most 0.1 units with confidence 90%
